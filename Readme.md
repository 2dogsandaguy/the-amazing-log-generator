## Installation
Clone or Download the Code:
You can either download the code as a ZIP file from a code-sharing platform (if available) or use Git to clone the repository. Here's how to clone the repository using Git clone. 
Navigate to the Code Directory:
Use the cd command to move into the directory containing the code.
Install Dependencies:
In the directory where the code is located, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required dependencies (inquirer).
Run the Code:
After the installation of dependencies is complete, you can run the code using Node.js with the following command.
Follow the On-Screen Prompts:
Once you run the code, it will prompt you for input, as described in the previous descriptions. Provide the requested input, including text, text color, shape choice, and shape color.
View the Generated HTML:
After providing input, the program will generate an HTML file named index.html in the same directory. Open this file in a web browser to view the SVG image based on your input.

## Tests
THERE IS A LIVE TEST DEMO IN THE LINKS SECTION 
* [Links](#links)
* Before running the tests, make sure you have completed the installation steps mentioned in the Usage section.
Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you have the SVG generator code. Use the cd command to change to the code directory.
Run the SVG generator code by executing the following command node your-code-file.js.
Here are some test cases you can perform to verify the functionality of the SVG generator:

Test Case 1: Basic SVG Generation
Input:

Text: "ABC"
Text Color: "#FF0000" (Red)
Shape: Circle
Shape Color: "#00FF00" (Green)
Expected Result:

The program should generate an SVG image with the text "ABC" displayed inside a red circle.
Test Case 2: Validating Input
Input:

Text: "" (Empty)
Text Color: "blue"
Shape: Triangle
Shape Color: "#123"
Expected Result:

The program should validate the input and provide appropriate error messages for invalid input (empty text and incorrect color formats).
Test Case 3: SVG with Different Shapes
Input:

Text: "123"
Text Color: "#000"
Shape: Square
Shape Color: "yellow"
Expected Result:

The program should generate an SVG image with the text "123" displayed inside a yellow square.
After providing input and running the tests, the program will generate an HTML file named index.html in the same directory. Open this file in a web browser to visually inspect the SVG images generated during testing.
